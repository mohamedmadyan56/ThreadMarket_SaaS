# FashionConnect Backend Architecture

## 1. Backend Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Recommended Solution Architecture

The backend should be implemented as a modular monolith using Express.js and TypeScript, backed by PostgreSQL through Prisma ORM. This choice is the most appropriate for the MVP and near-term roadmap because:

- the domain is highly relational and already modeled in PostgreSQL;
- the business workflows span authentication, catalog, orders, payments, delivery, disputes, and admin governance in tightly coupled ways;
- the team is small (three backend developers), so a modular monolith minimizes operational complexity while remaining extensible;
- future evolution into services can be handled later if the platform grows.

### 1.2 Technology Stack

- Runtime: Node.js 20+
- Framework: Express.js
- Language: TypeScript
- ORM: Prisma
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache/Queue: Redis + BullMQ
- Real-time: Socket.IO
- Auth: JWT access token + refresh token
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- API docs: Swagger/OpenAPI
- Validation: Zod (recommended) or express-validator
- Logging: Pino + structured logs
- Testing: Jest + Supertest + Prisma test database

### 1.3 Architectural Layers

- Presentation Layer: REST API routes
- Application Layer: controllers, services, use-cases
- Domain Layer: business rules and orchestration
- Data Layer: Prisma repositories, PostgreSQL, Redis, queues
- Integration Layer: payment gateways, notification providers, file storage, delivery partner webhooks

### 1.4 Core Design Principles

- Keep business logic inside services, not controllers
- Use transactions for financial and order-changing operations
- Treat money as append-only ledger data and not as mutable balance fields
- Enforce ownership and role-based authorization centrally
- Use idempotency keys for payment and webhook operations
- Make all external calls asynchronous where safe
- Log all admin actions and financial mutations

## 5. Validation Rules

### 5.1 Shared Validation Rules

- phone: required for register, unique, E.164-like format preferred
- email: optional for some roles, but if present must be valid email
- password: minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase/lowercase/number
- role: restricted to enum values
- governorate/city/street: required for address and checkout
- paymentMethod: must be one of allowed enum values
- quantity: min 1
- price/amount: positive numeric values
- stock: non-negative integer
- rating: 1-5 inclusive
- SKU: unique string
- file uploads: allowed mimetypes and size limits

### 5.2 Endpoint-Specific Validation Notes

- Register: require phone and password; email optional
- Login: require either email or phone, plus password
- OTP send: require phone or email and purpose
- Checkout: require addressId, paymentMethod, non-empty cart
- Brand document upload: require docType and file
- Product create/update: require name_ar and price/variant data
- Order status transitions: require allowed transition based on current status
- Delivery proof: require photo or OTP confirmation
- Admin actions: require reason/notes for sensitive changes

## 6. Authorization Model

### 6.1 Role-Based Access Rules

- end_user: self-service access to own cart, checkout, profile, orders, reviews, wishlist, chat
- brand: access to own brand profile, own catalog, own sub-orders, own payouts, own ad campaigns
- admin: platform-wide read/write for trust, payouts, disputes, moderation, reports, ranking
- sub_admin: scoped access based on assigned permissions
- delivery_company: access to own company’s orders, couriers, zones, and reconciliation
- courier: access only to assigned orders and proof submission

### 6.2 Ownership Rules

- Users can only access their own cart, orders, addresses, wallet, and notifications.
- Brands can only manage their own catalog and orders.
- Delivery companies can only manage their own fleet and orders.
- Admin actions must be logged and scoped.

### 6.3 Permission Rules

- Permissions are stored in permissions and user_permissions.
- The application should resolve permissions via middleware that checks the JWT role and permission claims.

---

## 7. Database Operations and Transaction Strategy

### 7.1 Transaction Requirements

The following flows must be transactional:

- checkout and order creation
- payment confirmation with order state update
- payout approval and ledger update
- brand verification transition with notification dispatch
- dispute resolution and refund issuance

### 7.2 Read/Write Patterns

- Use Prisma transactions for multi-table writes.
- Use Redis for caching public catalog data and ranking scores.
- Use background jobs for ranking recalculation, notification dispatch, reporting generation, and returns processing.

### 7.3 Rollback Scenarios

- If checkout fails after order creation, the transaction rolls back and no partial order remains.
- If payment webhook arrives twice, the service must treat the second event as duplicate and not double-apply state changes.
- If payout approval fails after ledger mutation, the payout transition must be rolled back and logged.

## 10. Implementation Order

### Phase 1 — Foundation

1. Authentication and user profiles
2. Address management
3. Brands and verification
4. Uploads

### Phase 2 — Commerce Core

5. Categories and products
6. Cart and checkout
7. Orders and sub-orders
8. Reviews

### Phase 3 — Delivery and Finance

9. Delivery companies, couriers, proofs
10. Payments, wallets, payouts
11. COD reconciliation

### Phase 4 — Experience and Governance

12. Notifications and chat
13. Admin moderation and disputes
14. Ads and ranking
15. Reporting and analytics

### Dependency Notes

- Checkout depends on products, cart, address, payment, and delivery pricing.
- Orders depend on checkout and brand verification.
- Delivery depends on order handoff and sub-order modeling.
- Payouts depend on payment state and admin approval.
- Admin workflows depend on role-based authorization and audit logging.

---

## 11. Team Planning (Three Backend Developers)

### Backend Developer A

- Modules: auth, users, addresses, brands, uploads
- Estimated days: 18
- Dependencies: none / basic shared auth services
- Parallel work: can develop validators and shared middleware independently
- Merge order: first merge after auth and users are stable

### Backend Developer B

- Modules: categories, products, cart, checkout, orders, reviews
- Estimated days: 24
- Dependencies: auth, users, brands, uploads
- Parallel work: can build catalog and checkout in parallel after shared models are ready
- Merge order: second merge after checkout and order flows are integrated

### Backend Developer C

- Modules: delivery, payments, payouts, wallets, notifications, chat, admin, queues, reports
- Estimated days: 26
- Dependencies: orders, payments, delivery, admin auth
- Parallel work: can build worker jobs and admin features while others finish commerce core
- Merge order: final merge after end-to-end order flow is validated

---

## 12. API Documentation Notes

### Swagger/OpenAPI Recommendations

- Tag endpoints by domain: auth, users, brands, catalog, orders, delivery, payments, chat, admin
- Add securitySchemes for bearerAuth
- Use examples for each major payload
- Document all enum values for status, roles, and payment methods

### Standard API Envelope

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

---

## 13. Engineering Notes

### Missing Endpoints / Gaps to Address

- A dedicated upload metadata persistence table is recommended if file inspection and audit are needed.
- A dedicated payment provider config table is recommended for gateway credentials and provider selection.
- A dedicated support ticket table is recommended if the support workflow is part of the roadmap.
- A dedicated product inventory reservation table is recommended for high-volume inventory protection.

### Redundant or Ambiguous Endpoints

- Public brand profile and public product detail routes should be clearly separated from private management routes.
- The current schema uses one orders table and multiple sub_orders; route naming should consistently use sub-order resources when brand-specific actions are involved.

### Performance Concerns

- Product search should use full-text indexing and caching.
- Ranking score reads should come from Redis or precomputed tables.
- Notification dispatch should be asynchronous.

### Security Concerns

- Payment webhooks must be validated with provider signatures.
- JWT secrets must be rotated and stored in environment variables.
- External file storage must use signed URLs and scoped access.
- Admin actions must be logged and permission-checked.

### Scalability Improvements

- Introduce queue workers for notifications, ranking recalculation, and reports.
- Add read replicas for analytics and reporting endpoints.
- Use background jobs for heavy catalog indexing and moderation reviews.

## 14. Recommended Prisma Model Structure

The Prisma schema should reflect the corrected PostgreSQL model. Core model groups should include:

- Auth: User, RefreshToken, OtpCode, Permission, UserPermission
- Commerce: Brand, BrandDocument, Category, Product, Variant, Cart, CartItem, Order, SubOrder, OrderItem, Return
- Delivery: DeliveryCompany, DeliveryZone, Courier, DeliveryProof, CodReconciliation
- Finance: Transaction, Payout, Wallet, WalletTransaction, LoyaltyPoint, Referral
- Communication: Review, ReviewImage, ChatThread, ChatMessage, NotificationTemplate, Notification
- Admin: Dispute, DisputeEvidence, ModerationFlag, AdminAuditLog

---

## 15. Recommended Operational Setup

### Docker Compose Services

- app
- postgres
- redis
- worker
- mailhog or local SMTP relay

### Environment Variables

- DATABASE_URL
- REDIS_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- PAYMOB_SECRET
- STORAGE_BUCKET
- SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY
- APP_PORT

## 16. Definition of Done for Backend

The backend implementation is considered complete when:

- all critical routes are implemented and documented;
- authentication and authorization work end-to-end;
- checkout and payment flows are transactional and idempotent;
- order and delivery status transitions are audited;
- admin moderation and dispute flows are functional;
- tests cover critical happy paths and error handling;
- OpenAPI documentation is updated;
- Docker and environment configuration work locally.
